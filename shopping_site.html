            <p class="mb-2">The La Sportiva Skwama is a high end, mid-stiffness performance shoe which used the P3 midsole technology 
                to keep the aggressive profile of the shoe over its lifetime. Some exciting new features of the shoe include the S-Heel 
                construction which uses two different types of rubber compound to maintain rigidity and stability in the heel no matter 
                which direction your heel hooks are pulling in. There is also a split sole which allows the sole to spread a little when 
                weighted, this reduces any edge deformation.

            <img src="grigri.jpeg" alt="grigri - no image">
            <p class="mb-2">The Petzl GriGri is the latest redesign of the classic assisted-braking device. The GriGri lets climbers get on
                 with climbing without worrying about the belayers actions interfering with progression up a route through a smoother 
                 belaying action, even if the actual belay technique remains the same. The Petzl GriGri now allows the use of thinner ropes,
                  you can now use diameters of between 8.5 and 11mm. Even though thinnner ropes are now facilitated, the lowering of a 
                  climber is actually smoother due to a revised descent control system giving a larger 'sweet spot' and more progressive 
                  assisted braking capability. The icing on the cake is that the GriGri only weighs in at 175g, is 5% lighter, and with an 
                  updated design is more durable and easy-to-use than the GriGri 2.
